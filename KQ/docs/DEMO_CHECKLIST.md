# Demo Checklist — Project North Star

Purpose:  
Provide a **calm, confident, 3–7 minute demo** that shows value immediately, without over-explaining or live debugging.

This checklist is designed to **reduce cognitive load** for both the presenter and the audience.

---

## 1) Pre-Demo Setup (Do This Before Anyone Is Watching)

- [ ] App runs locally without errors
- [ ] Repo is clean (no debug prints, no half-features visible)
- [ ] Demo Mode is ON (if applicable)
- [ ] One browser tab per app (no tab chaos)
- [ ] README for the app is open in a second tab (backup)

**Golden rule:**  
If something *might* fail live, hide it.

---

## 2) Demo Framing (30 seconds — Say This Out Loud)

> “This is part of **Project North Star** — a collection of small, accessible tools designed to make STEM, coding, and organization easier for diverse learners and educators.”

Key points to hit:
- Built for **clarity**, not complexity
- Designed to work within **real school constraints**
- Modular: tools can stand alone or live inside a hub

Do **not**:
- Explain your entire philosophy
- Explain how long it took
- Explain future plans unless asked

---

## 3) Core Flow Demo (2–4 minutes)

### Step 1 — Orientation (10–15 seconds)
- Point out:
  - Title
  - One-sentence purpose
  - Where the main action happens

> “Everything important happens here.”

---

### Step 2 — One Successful Action (60–90 seconds)
Choose **one**:
- Generate something
- Upload something
- Select something
- Export something

Narrate lightly:
- “Input on the left”
- “Preview on the right”
- “Confirm → output”

This is the **heart of the demo**.

---

### Step 3 — Output Proof (30–60 seconds)
Show that the tool produces:
- A usable image
- A downloadable file
- A structured block
- A student-ready artifact

Say:
> “This is something you could actually use or share.”

---

## 4) Accessibility + Design Callout (30 seconds)

Highlight **one**:
- Visual clarity
- Reduced reading
- Large buttons
- Predictable layout
- Minimal typing

Frame it as intentional:
> “This was designed for learners who need structure and visual grounding.”

Avoid buzzwords unless prompted.

---

## 5) Teacher / Colleague Relevance (30–60 seconds)

Answer **one** of these:
- How this saves time
- How this reduces friction
- How this helps explain a concept
- How this supports diverse learners

Example:
> “Instead of building this from scratch, this gives you a starting point.”

---

## 6) Safe Exit (10–20 seconds)

End on stability:
- Return to home page
- Show repo structure briefly
- Close with:

> “Everything here is modular — you can use one piece or build on it.”

Do **not**:
- Start clicking randomly
- Add new features live
- Open unfinished pages

---

## 7) If Something Breaks (Contingency Plan)

Say calmly:
> “That’s okay — I have a static example.”

Then:
- Show screenshot
- Show README
- Explain intended output (briefly)

**Confidence > perfection**

---

## 8) After the Demo (Optional)

If asked:
- Share GitHub link
- Offer a short follow-up demo
- Ask what problem *they* want solved

Do not:
- Apologize excessively
- Over-justify design choices

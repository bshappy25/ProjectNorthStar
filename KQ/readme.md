# Project North Star — Global README (KQ Operating System)

This repo is the single source of truth for my apps, tools, and demos.
ChatGPT is used as a collaborator, but GitHub is the record.

---

## A) Personal (Life OS)
**Purpose**
- Maintain stability, clarity, and follow-through while keeping life simple.

**Non-negotiables**
- Sleep protection and recovery time
- A “minimum viable day” plan when energy is low
- Gentle structure > perfection

**Working style**
- I do best with: short steps, visible progress, low-friction checklists
- I avoid: sprawling plans, too many parallel tasks, overly emotional framing

**Boundaries**
- Only store personal context if explicitly marked **KEEP**
- Default: no personal memory retention

**Quick status template**
- Energy: Low / Mid / High  
- One win today:  
- One next step:  
- One thing to defer:

---

## B) Teacher (District 75 / STEM / Accessibility)
**Mission**
- Create accessible, engaging STEM learning experiences for diverse learners.

**Core principles**
- Visual-first, step-based instruction
- Multiple modalities (text + image + audio) with low reading burden
- “Leader by example” culture: tools that help students and staff succeed

**Outputs I build**
- Interactive lessons (Google Sites + embedded HTML tools)
- Student-friendly READMEs / directions
- Quick demos for colleagues (1–3 minute setup, obvious payoff)

**Standards approach**
- NGSS-aligned where possible
- Keep standards mapping modular + reusable (database / JSON / CSV patterns)

**Classroom constraints**
- Simple UI, big buttons, minimal typing
- Works on common DOE devices/browsers

---

## C) Dev (DevForge / Tool Hubs / HTML Apps)
**Repo truth**
- Everything ships from GitHub. No “only in chat” code.

**Primary stack**
- Streamlit hubs (DevForge style)
- Standalone HTML tools for embedding in Sites
- Small utilities: token demos, image/text portals, block tools

**Dev rules**
- One feature per commit
- “Bulletproof over clever”
- Stable export paths (JPG/PNG/ZIP/HTML)
- Admin gates must be obvious and safe

**Folder conventions (suggested)**
- `/python_hubs/Dev_Forge/` = Streamlit multi-page hub
- `/teacher_tools/` = standalone HTML tools for Sites embedding
- `/docs/` = READMEs, demo scripts, screenshots
- `/assets/` = images, icons, palettes
- `/data/` = db/json/csv

**Definition of Done**
- Runs locally
- Has a README with install + demo steps
- Has at least one screenshot/GIF
- Has a “Demo Mode” toggle if needed

---

## D) Finance (Simple + Separated)
**Goal**
- Keep money decisions calm, compartmentalized, and repeatable.

**Rules**
- Separate “living” vs “building” vs “experiments”
- Avoid constant re-optimizing
- Use budgets that match real behavior (simple caps)

**Cadence**
- Weekly 15-minute check (balances + upcoming bills)
- Monthly review (one page summary)

**Where code fits**
- If a tool touches money: it must be transparent, auditable, and stored in GitHub.
- No hidden automation without a paper trail.

---

## E) KQ-Specific Content (Brand / Universe / Identity Layer)
**Identity**
- King Quantum (KQ): creative technologist + educator + builder of tools and worlds.

**Creative pillars**
- “Tools as art” (clean UI, symbolic color systems)
- Character-driven systems (mascots, themes, tokens, demos)
- Narrative structure (rings/zones/milestones) used to drive consistency

**KQ output types**
- Demo tokens / admin demo mode artifacts
- Themed pages (cards, portals, viewers)
- “Leader” framing for school/community impact

**KQ rule**
- Style supports function. If style blocks shipping, simplify.

---

# Operating Agreement with ChatGPT (Fresh Baseline)
1) Treat GitHub as truth.
2) Default to short outputs + copy/paste blocks.
3) Ask: “What is the single demo-critical thing?”
4) Only retain memory if I write **KEEP:** explicitly.

Absolutely. Here’s a clean, grounded README.md that captures what you’ve built—no fluff, no overreach.

King Quantum (KQ)

Overview

King Quantum (KQ) is a unified identity system expressed through symbols, idols, logic modes, and visual archetypes.
It blends creativity, structure, empathy, and strategic thinking into a coherent framework for communication, design, and meaning-making.

This repository documents the language, logic, and forms of KQ.

⸻

Core Identity
	•	Name: King Quantum (KQ)
	•	Nature: Singular identity, multiple expressions
	•	Center: Onyx (neutral, grounding, integrative)
	•	Mode: Intentional, reflective, adaptive

Different forms. Same core.

⸻

Idols

Idols are symbolic representations—not literal people or animals.
They are expressions of KQ traits in visual, friendly, neutral forms.

Mr. Benji (Primary Idol)
	•	Style: Clean black & white line art
	•	Pose: Neutral, friendly
	•	Platform: Podium with name
	•	Variants:
	•	Standard Idol
	•	Crown Idol (authority without domination)
	•	Bagel Logic Idol (contextual humor + logic)

Mr. Benji is not a cat.
Mr. Benji is an idol.

⸻

Logic Systems

ABC Logic
	•	A / B / C = branching options
	•	Used for choice, exploration, and iteration

S-Level (Stylistic / Feel)
	•	Controls how responses are delivered
	•	Example:
	•	S6 = Bagel Logic
	•	S6a: Salty
	•	S6b: Plain
	•	S6c: Toasted + Egg
	•	S6d: Humor applied intentionally

I-Logic
	•	Indentation
	•	Structure
	•	Code and clarity correction

⸻

Response Systems

Rainbow Response 🌈

Seven response tones:
	•	Red
	•	Orange
	•	Yellow
	•	Green
	•	Blue
	•	Indigo
	•	Violet

Stoplight Override 🚦

Overrides all other modes:
	•	🔴 Red: very short (not silence)
	•	🟡 Yellow: cautious / exploratory
	•	🟢 Green: explanatory / supportive

⸻

Response Square (RR)

Directional logic affecting intent:
	•	North – Wisdom, foresight, stability
	•	South – Release, letting go, disposal
	•	East – Context, perspective, framing
	•	West – Identity, reflection, contrast
	•	Center (Onyx) – Neutral processing point

KQ operates primarily from the center, moving outward intentionally.

⸻

Symbols & Commands
	•	🔒 Lock – finalize, no reinterpretation
	•	🎨 – visual / artistic output
	•	🌶️ – spicy (direct, layered, challenging)
	•	🦁 – calm authority, restrained power
	•	22.22 / 22222 – infinite possibility + creative command

⸻

Design Philosophy
	•	Authority without noise
	•	Creativity with structure
	•	Empathy without collapse
	•	Humor without chaos

Power through understanding.
Expression through control.

⸻

Status

This system is:
	•	Stable
	•	Self-consistent
	•	Intentionally bounded

No further expansion required unless explicitly unlocked.

⸻

King Quantum 👑
One identity. Many forms. Locked. 🔒

# Project North Star — Global README (KQ Operating System)

This repo is the single source of truth for my apps, tools, and demos.
ChatGPT is used as a collaborator, but GitHub is the record.

---

## A) Personal (Life OS)
**Purpose**
- Maintain stability, clarity, and follow-through while keeping life simple.

**Non-negotiables**
- Sleep protection and recovery time
- A “minimum viable day” plan when energy is low
- Gentle structure > perfection

**Working style**
- I do best with: short steps, visible progress, low-friction checklists
- I avoid: sprawling plans, too many parallel tasks, overly emotional framing

**Boundaries**
- Only store personal context if explicitly marked **KEEP**
- Default: no personal memory retention

**Quick status template**
- Energy: Low / Mid / High  
- One win today:  
- One next step:  
- One thing to defer:

## B) Teacher (District 75 / STEM / Accessibility)
**Mission**
- Create accessible, engaging STEM learning experiences for diverse learners.

**Core principles**
- Visual-first, step-based instruction
- Multiple modalities (text + image + audio) with low reading burden
- “Leader by example” culture: tools that help students and staff succeed

**Outputs I build**
- Interactive lessons (Google Sites + embedded HTML tools)
- Student-friendly READMEs / directions
- Quick demos for colleagues (1–3 minute setup, obvious payoff)

**Standards approach**
- NGSS-aligned where possible
- Keep standards mapping modular + reusable (database / JSON / CSV patterns)

**Classroom constraints**
- Simple UI, big buttons, minimal typing
- Works on common DOE devices/browsers

---

## C) Dev (DevForge / Tool Hubs / HTML Apps)
**Repo truth**
- Everything ships from GitHub. No “only in chat” code.

**Primary stack**
- Streamlit hubs (DevForge style)
- Standalone HTML tools for embedding in Sites
- Small utilities: token demos, image/text portals, block tools

**Dev rules**
- One feature per commit
- “Bulletproof over clever”
- Stable export paths (JPG/PNG/ZIP/HTML)
- Admin gates must be obvious and safe

**Folder conventions (suggested)**
- `/python_hubs/Dev_Forge/` = Streamlit multi-page hub
- `/teacher_tools/` = standalone HTML tools for Sites embedding
- `/docs/` = READMEs, demo scripts, screenshots
- `/assets/` = images, icons, palettes
- `/data/` = db/json/csv

**Definition of Done**
- Runs locally
- Has a README with install + demo steps
- Has at least one screenshot/GIF
- Has a “Demo Mode” toggle if needed

---

## D) Finance (Simple + Separated)
**Goal**
- Keep money decisions calm, compartmentalized, and repeatable.

**Rules**
- Separate “living” vs “building” vs “experiments”
- Avoid constant re-optimizing
- Use budgets that match real behavior (simple caps)

**Cadence**
- Weekly 15-minute check (balances + upcoming bills)
- Monthly review (one page summary)

**Where code fits**
- If a tool touches money: it must be transparent, auditable, and stored in GitHub.
- No hidden automation without a paper trail.

---

## E) KQ-Specific Content (Brand / Universe / Identity Layer)
**Identity**
- King Quantum (KQ): creative technologist + educator + builder of tools and worlds.

**Creative pillars**
- “Tools as art” (clean UI, symbolic color systems)
- Character-driven systems (mascots, themes, tokens, demos)
- Narrative structure (rings/zones/milestones) used to drive consistency

**KQ output types**
- Demo tokens / admin demo mode artifacts
- Themed pages (cards, portals, viewers)
- “Leader” framing for school/community impact

**KQ rule**
- Style supports function. If style blocks shipping, simplify.

# Operating Agreement with ChatGPT (Fresh Baseline)
1) Treat GitHub as truth.
2) Default to short outputs + copy/paste blocks.
3) Ask: “What is the single demo-critical thing?”
4) Only retain memory if I write **KEEP:** explicitly.

# BSChapp - ProjectNorthStar
The ultimate education app for teachers by teachers

## Vision

**Teacher-First. Print-First. Admin-Blind by Default.**

BSChapp is built on the principle that teachers should have sovereign control over their educational materials. We prioritize:

- **Teacher Sovereignty**: Teachers own their content, workflows, and pedagogical decisions
- **Print-First Design**: All materials are optimized for physical printing and classroom use
- **Admin-Blind Architecture**: Administrative systems have no default visibility into teacher workflows
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Simple, reliable tools that work offline and require minimal setup
- **NGSS Alignment**: Standards-aligned content without bureaucratic overhead

## Development Phases

### Phase 0: Foundation (Current)
- ✅ Repository scaffold and structure
- ✅ Core directories established
- 🔄 Protection doctrine implementation
- 🔄 Base schemas and contracts

### Phase 1: Core Python Hubs
- Logic engine for educational operations
- Content generators for printable materials
- NGSS standards integration

### Phase 2: Printessa Materials System
- HTML/CSS printable templates
- Print-optimized layouts
- Teacher-customizable designs

### Phase 3: Artifact Management
- Teacher-owned artifact storage
- Schema validation
- Print rule enforcement

### Phase 4: Integration & Refinement
- End-to-end workflows
- Teacher feedback integration
- Performance optimization

## Protection Doctrine

### Teacher Data Sovereignty
1. **No External Transmission**: Teacher artifacts never leave local control without explicit consent
2. **Admin Blind**: Administrative users cannot access teacher-created materials by default
3. **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive materials encrypted with teacher-controlled keys
4. **Audit Logs**: All access to teacher materials is logged and visible to teachers

### Print-First Guarantee
1. **Offline Capability**: Core functions work without internet connectivity
2. **Print Reliability**: All materials tested for print quality and readability
3. **Ink Efficiency**: Designs optimized to minimize ink usage
4. **Standard Paper**: Support for standard Letter and A4 paper sizes

### Minimal Sovereignty
1. **No Bloat**: Only essential features included
2. **Teacher Control**: Teachers can disable/enable features as needed
3. **Clear Documentation**: Every feature clearly documented with plain language
4. **Open Architecture**: Extensible by teachers with basic programming knowledge

## Clock-It-1234 Failsafe

**Emergency Teacher Data Protection Protocol**

In case of system compromise, administrative overreach, or forced data collection:

```
ACTIVATION CODE: Clock-It-1234
```

### Failsafe Actions:
1. **Immediate Local Backup**: All teacher artifacts exported to encrypted local storage
2. **Connection Severing**: All external connections terminated
3. **Access Lockdown**: Administrative access immediately revoked
4. **Teacher Notification**: All teachers notified via multiple channels
5. **Audit Trail Generation**: Complete access logs generated for teacher review

### Activation:
Teachers can activate this failsafe at any time by entering `Clock-It-1234` in the system console or executing the failsafe script.

```bash
# TODO: Implement failsafe script
# python scripts/failsafe_clock_it_1234.py
```

## Getting Started

<!-- TODO: Add setup instructions once Phase 1 begins -->

This is a foundational scaffold. No features are implemented yet—only structure, contracts, and protective principles.

## Contributing

This project is teacher-first. All contributions must align with our protection doctrine and sovereignty principles.

<!-- TODO: Add contribution guidelines -->

BSChapp — v2

Structured Human Input → AI-Ready Output (Teacher-First)

Overview

BSChapp v2 builds directly on a frozen, working v1.
The goal of v2 is not more automation, but better structure so both teachers and AI can work from the same clear skeleton.

v1 proved the system works.
v2 defines the contract.

⸻

Core Principle

Teachers author meaning. Systems assist later.

All BSChapp artifacts are:
	•	Teacher-written
	•	Print-first
	•	Predictably structured
	•	Free of analytics, tracking, or admin leverage

AI is downstream, optional, and constrained.

⸻

Why the v1 Output Matters

The current worksheet / exit ticket / lesson plan format is intentionally minimal.

It includes:
	•	Stable headers (grade band, subject, unit, date)
	•	Clearly labeled instructional sections
	•	Plain-language teacher voice
	•	A visible authorship marker (signature)
	•	No hidden logic

This makes the files:
	•	Immediately usable by teachers
	•	Legible to substitutes
	•	Machine-readable without prompt hacks

⸻

v2 Design Philosophy

Rigid structure. Flexible content.
	•	Fixed rails (grade band, subject, unit)
	•	Free-text sections for teacher judgment
	•	No inferred intent
	•	No behavior scoring
	•	No student data ingestion

If it can’t be printed and handed out, it doesn’t belong.

⸻

How AI Will Interact (Future, Optional)

In v2+, AI will:
	•	Read completed BSChapp documents
	•	Respect section boundaries
	•	Generate suggestions only when explicitly requested
	•	Never overwrite teacher text
	•	Never run silently or automatically

These documents act as contracts, not prompts.

⸻

Why This Works for Teachers
	•	Looks like a normal worksheet
	•	Prints cleanly in black & white
	•	Editable digitally or by hand
	•	No new workflow to learn
	•	No accounts, logins, or dashboards

Teachers already know how to use this.

⸻

Why This Works for AI
	•	Clear semantic markers
	•	Predictable labels
	•	Low noise
	•	No hidden state
	•	Explicit authorship and intent

AI doesn’t need creativity here — it needs clarity.

⸻

What v2 Will Add (Deliberately Limited)
	•	AI reads existing BSChapp files
	•	Optional suggestion panel (never auto-fill)
	•	Science-only awareness (NGSS / 5E)
	•	Version awareness (v1 artifacts remain valid)

No analytics. No scoring. No surveillance.

⸻

Version Status
	•	v1: Frozen, stable, production-ready
	•	v2: Specification defined, implementation pending

The principle remains unchanged:
Teacher first. System second. Admin last.

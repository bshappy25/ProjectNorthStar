# KQ Logic — Private Operating Layer

Status: PRIVATE  
Audience: Me (KQ) only  
Visibility: Not for demos, not for colleagues, not for students

This app exists to hold **my internal logic systems** so they do not leak into
professional tools, teaching artifacts, or public demos.

---

## Purpose

KQ Logic is a **personal reasoning engine**.

It helps me:
- Regulate energy and attention
- Encode patterns I already use intuitively
- Reduce cognitive load by externalizing decision logic
- Keep identity, symbolism, and planning *contained*

This is not a productivity app.  
This is not a teaching tool.  
This is not a brand artifact.

It is an internal scaffold.

## Core Principles

1. **Containment over expression**
   - If it feels expressive, it belongs elsewhere.
   - If it stabilizes me, it belongs here.

2. **Logic > narrative**
   - Systems, states, and switches.
   - Minimal prose. No lore.

3. **Private by default**
   - No obligation to explain.
   - No optimization for others.

4. **Low energy safe**
   - Must be usable on tired days.
   - Must never demand perfection.

## What Lives Here

### Identity Logic
- Modes, roles, and states I move between
- No justification required

### Energy Regulation
- Low / Mid / High states
- What is allowed or disallowed in each
- Recovery-first assumptions

### Rings & Zones
- Scope boundaries (today / week / season / year)
- What matters *now* vs later
- Explicit deferral logic

### Symbol Mapping
- Colors, icons, shorthand markers
- Used as anchors, not aesthetics

---

## What Does NOT Live Here

- Student language
- Teaching standards
- Demos
- Public explanations
- Anything that needs to “make sense” to others

If something becomes explanatory → it moves out.

---

## Relationship to Project North Star

- KQ Logic is **upstream**, not central.
- Other apps may *optionally* read from it later.
- Nothing here should be required to run DevForge or teacher tools.

North Star remains stable even if KQ Logic is offline.

---

## Operational Rules

- No refactors during emotional spikes
- No feature creep
- One file = one idea
- When in doubt, pause

This app is here to **reduce pressure**, not create it.

---

## Maintenance Cadence

- Touch only when needed
- Review monthly at most
- Archive ideas instead of expanding them

Silence is allowed.

---

## Final Note

This space is allowed to be:
- Incomplete
- Quiet
- Boring

If it keeps me steady, it’s doing its job.

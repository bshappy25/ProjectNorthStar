🌌 Project Northstar

The Starlight Ecosystem Blueprint

Built with discipline.
Guided by purpose.
Anchored in CareOn.

⸻

1. Vision

Project Northstar is not a single application.

It is a modular digital ecosystem designed to empower:
	•	Teachers
	•	Students (Starlight)
	•	Creators
	•	Collaborators
	•	Investors

All unified under a shared philosophy: CareOn.

Northstar is designed for longevity, integrity, and global educational impact.

⸻

2. Core Philosophy — CareOn

CareOn = Care + On
	•	Care for the planet
	•	Turn on a world of possibilities

CareOn is both:
	•	A moral framework

It flows through every module in the ecosystem.

⸻

3. System Architecture Overview

Northstar is modular.

Each module operates independently but connects through:
	•	Unified authentication
